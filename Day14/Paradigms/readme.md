## ‚úÖ What is a Programming Paradigm?

A **Programming Paradigm** is a fundamental style or approach to writing computer programs. It defines how you structure your code and think about solving problems.

### ‚úÖ Popular Programming Paradigms

| Paradigm                              | Description                                                                                                          | Example Languages                               |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Procedural Programming**            | Organizes code into procedures (functions). Focuses on step-by-step instructions.                                    | C, Pascal, Basic, Python (can be used this way) |
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Organizes code using classes and objects. Focuses on data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. | Python, Java, C++, C#                           |
| **Functional Programming**            | Treats computation as evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding changing states.                                | Haskell, Lisp, Scala, Python (supports)         |
| **Logical Programming**               | Based on formal logic, where you declare facts and rules, and the system derives conclusions.                        | Prolog                                          |

## ‚úÖ OOP Paradigm vs Procedural Paradigm (Simple Comparison)

| Feature             | Procedural Paradigm                    | OOP Paradigm                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structure           | Functions and data are separate        | Data and functions are together in classes                     |
| Data Handling       | Data is openly accessible              | Data is encapsulated (private/protected)                       |
| Reusability         | Low, requires rewriting code           | High, with inheritance and polymorphism                        |
| Real-world Modeling | Difficult to map to real-world objects | Easy mapping (objects represent real-world things)             |
| Example Approach    | Write sequence of steps (procedures)   | Define objects (e.g., Car, Animal) with properties and methods |

## ‚úÖ Real-World Analogy (Paradigm Analogy)

### üèó Procedural Paradigm:

* Like following a step-by-step recipe in a cookbook.
* Example:

  1. Chop vegetables
  2. Boil water
  3. Cook vegetables
     Each step is separate and executed in order.

---

### üè¢ Object-Oriented Paradigm:

* Like designing a car where each part (engine, wheel, door) is an object with properties and actions.
* Example:

  * Engine object ‚Üí start(), stop()
  * Wheel object ‚Üí rotate()
  * Car object ‚Üí uses Engine and Wheels ‚Üí drive(), park()

## ‚úÖ Why OOP is Popular

‚úîÔ∏è Promotes modular code
‚úîÔ∏è Easy to maintain
‚úîÔ∏è Reusable components
‚úîÔ∏è Clear real-world mapping
‚úîÔ∏è Easier for large projects
